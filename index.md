Hi! Welcome to my random collection of things I have done and things I can do. If you are here by accident, it is probably because you hit my
highly googleable list of skills below.

If you are here on purpose, then you know that I am a Software / Systems Engineer
at Weaveworks where I do lots of fun opensource Kubernetes related things.
I am currently NOT in the market for a new Software Engineering role.

Once upon a time I built containers and then went to conferences to stand on stage
talking about building those containers.
I also won a "[Quiet Achiever](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/and-the-community-award-recipients-are/)"
award for my containery work... anyone
who knows me will no-doubt find that hilarious.

I write a blog at a cadence of about 1 post per year.

Here is that seo-d list of things I do:
- containers
- kubernetes
- linux
- bash
- sysadmin
- cloud computing
- devops
- unix
- golang
- aws / gcp
- cloud foundry paas
- bosh
- vim
- ansible
- ci / cd
- tdd
- pair programming
- conference talking
- product management
- line management
- [mentoring](/resources) / advice giving
