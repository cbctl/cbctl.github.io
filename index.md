<p>hi! welcome to my random collection of things I have done and things I can do. if you are here by accident, it is probably because your search hit my
optimised list of buzzwordy skills below. if you are here on purpose, then you know
that I am a Software / Systems Engineer. you know that I work at <a href="https://pivotal.io/">Pivotal</a> and that I build
containers and that I then go to conferences and stand on stage talking about building those containers.
or you are here because you are actually looking for unicorns and my url is
misleading... I can't help you with that.</p>

<p>
here is that seo-d list of things I do:
<ul>
<li> containers </li>
<li> linux </li>
<li> bash </li>
<li> sysadmin </li>
<li> cloud computing </li>
<li> unix </li>
<li> golang </li>
<li> vms </li>
<li> aws/gcp </li>
<li> cloud foundry paas </li>
<li> bosh </li>
<li> vim </li>
<li> ansible </li>
<li> ruby </li>
<li> ci/cd </li>
<li> tdd </li>
<li> pair programming </li>
<li> talking about those things at conferences </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
things I don't do:
<ul>
<li> web d3vel0pment (avoid those hits) or design. making this site was so tedious and I didn't even really do it myself I used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. </li>
</ul>
