Hi! I used to be an engineer. I am not anymore (at least I won't be for a
while).

So if you are here to find out more before sending me a recruitment email:
I am currently NOT in the market for a new Software Engineering role.

If you are here because you want to ask me about any of the things I did,
getting into software, or leaving software, please get in touch :)

Once upon a time I built container runtimes and kubernetes operators and then
went to conferences to stand on stage talking about building those things.
I also won a "[Quiet Achiever](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/and-the-community-award-recipients-are/)"
award for my containery work... anyone
who knows me will no-doubt find that hilarious.

My last role was a Software / Systems Engineer
at [Equinix Metal](https://deploy.equinix.com/) where I wrote some terrible Rust
to connect to remote hosts' BMCs.

I don't write blogs anymore, I don't do conference talks, but occasionally I write
[tutorials](/resources) for newbies, or notes on things I am tinkering with.

These are the things I used to do:
- containers
- kubernetes
- linux
- bash
- sysadmin
- cloud computing
- rust
- devops
- unix
- golang
- aws / gcp
- cloud foundry paas
- bosh
- vim
- ansible
- ci / cd
- tdd
- pair programming
- conference talking
- product management
- people management
- [mentoring](/resources) / advice giving
