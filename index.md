Hi! Welcome to my random collection of things I have done and things I can do. If you are here by accident, it is probably because you hit my
highly googleable list of skills below.

If you are here on purpose, then you know that I am a Software / Systems Engineer
and that I lead a team of very brilliant and lovely people at [Ori](https://www.ori.co/)
([we are hiring](https://angel.co/company/ori-industries-1/jobs/566175-software-engineer-all-levels) by the way).
You know that I design and build complex things with the use of Kubernetes controllers.

Once up on a time I built containers and then went to conferences to stand on stage
talking about building those containers.

I write a blog at a cadence of about 1 post per year.

Here is that seo-d list of things I do:
- containers
- kubernetes
- linux
- bash
- sysadmin
- cloud computing
- unix
- golang
- aws / gcp
- cloud foundry paas
- bosh
- vim
- ansible
- ruby
- ci / cd
- tdd
- pair programming
- conference talking
- project management
- line management
- [mentoring](/resources) / advice giving
