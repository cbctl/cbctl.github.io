I like reading and cooking and diy and programming and tattoos and martial arts and hiking and trekking
(not the kind of trekking where you dress up and maybe nimoy is there, but the kind
of trekking where it is just you in a remote mountain range with a tent and 2 weeks
of rations). on my days off I will either aim to read and finish a book or
I will look for something in my home which needs the sort of fixing that can only
be done by my most heaviest most loudest tools. unless I am speaking at a conference
and then I will fret over that.

I graduated from UCL with a degree in ancient history which I did not get to use because I 
then went to a web-dev bootcamp called <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers Academy</a> which I
only vaguely used as I did not become a web d3vel0per but somehow ended up deep in cloud computing.

I now live in East London with my wife (also an engineer) and our many cactuses (cacti? cactae?).
